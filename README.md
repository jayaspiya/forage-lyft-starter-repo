# Project Overview

Lyft is in the process of rolling out a new rental fleet in the hopes of encouraging more connected, sustainable cities across the US.

Your team has inherited an urgent project from a fellow colleague here at Lyft who had to make a pivot to a different project. The colleague was in the process of developing a component that is used by the rental fleet’s new logistics system. Unfortunately that component was only partially completed and your team’s responsibility is to now finalize that component and make it functional.

The component itself is responsible for determining whether cars in Lyft’s new rental fleet should be serviced when they are returned. The work you will do on this component will be carried through the each of the tasks within this program.

## Criteria for car servicing

The rental cars depends on the engine & the battery for car servicing.
